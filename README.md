Users will be able to add TV shows they are watching to the app. Every TV show instance will have a cover image, day of the week, time of day when new episodes will air, how many episodes have aired so far, the total amount of episodes the show will have when it finishes airing and how many episodes the user has watched. For each show, the user can change the cover image, increase or decrease the amount of episodes they have watched, change the time or day when new episodes release. Shows can also be deleted. Adding a show, updating the amount of watched episodes and deleting a show is persisted on the server and the local db.
